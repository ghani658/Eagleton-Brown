                                Mindy Brown has always been passionate about helping those in need and motivating

                            <p>
                                Before entering the financial services industry, she graduated from Oklahoma State
University in December 2004 with a Bachelor’s degree in Finance. Soon after, she
accepted her first job with A.G. Edwards, which later became Wells Fargo Advisors. In 2011,
she and her husband Kent teamed up with Paul & Jim Eagleton to form Eagleton Brown
Investment Group. A lifelong learner, Mindy also earned her CERTIFIED FINANCIAL
PLANNER™ Certification that year to help towards Eagleton Brown Investment Group

                                Outside of the office, you’ll find Mindy spending time with her husband (and co-worker)
Kent along with their two children Preston and Reagan. She’s a lifelong native of
Oklahoma and originally hails from Broken Arrow. The family has been attending the
Church at Battle Creek in Broken Arrow for over 16 years.
