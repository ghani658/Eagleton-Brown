                                Kent Brown is a planner by nature, which means he brings a consistent standard of
diligence to Eagleton Brown Investment Group. Throughout his 20-year career, he has
drawn upon his extensive training and experience to develop long-term investment plans
based on each individual’s specific needs. To Kent, being diligent means learning about
his client’s family, understanding their plans for the immediate & distant future, and
partnering with them throughout the entire journey.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout his long career at WFA including legacy firms like AG Edwards & Wachovia,
Kent & his partners recognized a better path through independence. This is one of the
reasons he helped pioneer Eagleton Brown Investment Group. He and the Eagleton
Brown Investment Group team (which includes his wife Mindy) thrive on breaking down
difficult concepts for their clients to help them understand their financial plan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kent graduated with a bachelors in both Financial Management & Business Management
from Western Kentucky University. In 2011, Kent earned his CERTIFIED FINANCIAL
PLANNER™ certification by demonstrating extensive knowledge and skill in analyzing
and developing personal, long-term financial strategies for clients. Awarded by the
Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc., the CFP® certification is one of the
most recognized certifications in the financial services industry
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having benefited from the YMCA while growing up in Louisiana, he now serves on the
YMCA of Greater Tulsa’s Metro Board of Directors to help provide those opportunities to
the next generation. But more than anything, Kent is passionate about his family. He and
wife Mindy love spending time with their kids Preston & Reagan. They serve at BattleCreek
Church, where they have attended for 16 years.
